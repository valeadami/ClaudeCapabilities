- Responsive design using HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, and vanilla JavaScript
- Real-time preview using Claude's artifact feature
- Step-by-step guide for deployment

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Claude AI (for code generation and assistance)

## 📘 How It Works

The following prompt is used to instruct Claude on creating this project:

```
You are tasked with creating a dynamic website portfolio using HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, and vanilla JavaScript. The website consists of four pages: index.html, aboutme.html, servizi.html, and contatti.html. All pages share the same header and footer.

Follow these steps to create the website structure:

1. HTML Structure:
   - Create four HTML files: index.html, aboutme.html, servizi.html, and contatti.html
   - Use the HTML5 doctype and include appropriate meta tags
   - Create a common header with the text "Valentina Adami" followed by her profession
   - Create a common footer with email, social media icons (LinkedIn, YouTube, Facebook) linked to respective profiles, and copyright information
   - Use semantic HTML elements where appropriate (e.g., <header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>)

2. CSS and Bootstrap:
   - Include the Bootstrap CSS file in the <head> of each HTML file
   - Create a custom CSS file (styles.css) and link it after the Bootstrap CSS
   - Use Bootstrap classes for responsive layout and components
   - Style the header, footer, and main content areas consistently across all pages
   - Ensure the design is mobile-responsive

3. JavaScript:
   - Create a script.js file and link it at the end of the <body> in each HTML file
   - Implement any necessary interactive features or dynamic content loading

4. Output Format:
   Provide the complete code for each file in the following format:
<file name="index.html">
<!-- HTML content for index.html -->
</file>
<file name="aboutme.html">
<!-- HTML content for aboutme.html -->
</file>
<file name="servizi.html">
<!-- HTML content for servizi.html -->
</file>
<file name="contatti.html">
<!-- HTML content for contatti.html -->
</file>
<file name="css/styles.css">
/* CSS content */
</file>
<file name="js/script.js">
// JavaScript content
</file>

Ensure that all files are properly structured, indented, and include necessary comments for clarity. The website should be functional, responsive, and adhere to modern web development best practices.
```

Claude then generates the code based on these specifications, which can be further customized and refined as needed.
